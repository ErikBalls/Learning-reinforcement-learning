In this repository I want to learn the basics of Reinforcement Learning and compare different models in different environments.
This Jupyter Notebook describes how to train models, how to evaluate those with the help of TensorBoard and how to load those models in order to visualise them.
I am using Gymnasium environments (https://gymnasium.farama.org/), stable-baselines3 (https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) and other imports like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. .
